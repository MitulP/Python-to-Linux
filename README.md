# Python-to-Linux

Python is very powerful language you can do anythings using it.
Here I can written a simple program which execute Linux/Unix shell script command through Python

For that you need to install Shell_command module in python

Please follow the below step to install module

1. pip install shell_command
Alternatively, you can download and unpack it manually from the shell_command PyPI page(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/shell_command).

There are no operating system or distribution specific versions of this module - it is a pure Python module that should work on all platforms (aside from :func:iter_shell_output being known not to work on Windows).

Supported Python versions are 2.7 and 3.2+.
